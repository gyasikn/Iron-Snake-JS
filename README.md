This game was created by me using Javascript, Canvas, HTML & CSS. It is a remake of the classic snake arcade game that everyone knows.

Directions: 

Try to get as much points as possible without dying by moving the snake & eating all the food that appears on screen!

Regular food = 1pt

Special Food = 10pts (Appear every 3 seconds in different locations).

Don't run into yourself or into the walls or you will die!

ENJOY!

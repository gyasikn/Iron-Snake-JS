# Python
## February 2018

`Welcome to my game Python!`

`This is a Canvas based Javascript game that I created in one week for Module 1 of Ironhack. It is a remake of the classic game "Snake". Technologies Used: Vanilla Javascript, Canvas, HTML & CSS.`

`Later on I will implement a High-Score feature where you will be able to save your data and display it on the site. Stay tuned!`

`Directions:`

`Try to get as much points as possible without dying by moving the snake & eating all the food that appears on screen!`

`Regular food = 1pt`

`PIZZA = 10pts (Appear every 3 seconds in different locations).`

`Don't run into yourself or into the perimeter or you will die!`


`Click the HELP button if you need further instructions.`

`ENJOY!`
